<h3>Map of Important Places For Shoegaze</h3>
<p1>This was one of the hardest maps to make as a lot of the information was hidden / not well documented.
    There is a reason why Shoegaze originally had the slogan of "The scene that celebrates itself!"
    Overall this map showcases the strange closesness yet distance the scene had with itself and others. Sure, 
    the musicans played shows and festivals but it just did not seem to be as energetic as the Grunge scene.
