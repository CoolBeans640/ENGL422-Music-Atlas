Final map
</h1>
<p1>For my final map I wanted to make it stand out and have it be sort of a 
    look into the future. However, in order to curate it I needed some help!
    I first had to create a reddit account, a forum social media that encourages discussions
    of niche topics, like Grungegaze.<br>
    <br>
    I was also given the opportunity to ask one of my favorite muscians, Daygraves 
    about his opinion on the genre. More on that later!
