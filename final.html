Final map
</h1>
<p1>For my final map I wanted to make it stand out and have it be sort of a 
    look into the future. However, in order to curate it I needed some help!
    I first had to create a reddit account, a forum social media that encourages discussions
    of niche topics, like Grungegaze.<br>
    <br>
    I was also given the opportunity to ask one of my favorite muscians, Daygraves 
    about his opinion on the genre. More on that later!
    <br>
    The map itself is probably my most experimental one yet. 
    In class we were told to challenge the idea of what a map was, and base it off 
    its 'mappiness', well I decided to take that idea and flip it on its head. 
    I took words used to describe the genre both postively, and negatively to create 
    a map that might hold the future to the genre.

    <br>I intentionally made the map look distorted and hazzy to:
    <br>1.Make a visualizaiton of the music itself<br>
    2. Showcase the uncertain future of the genre.
    <br>
    Also, if you have a moment I reccomend checking out the music u/nerdyoutbe linked to, 
    they made a cool Grungegaze Demo under the name 'stuck in ice'! I was unable to get the embed to work before the due date
