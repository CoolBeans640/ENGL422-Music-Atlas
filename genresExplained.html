      <h2>Hardcore</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Hardcore punk is an aggressive form of Punk Rock. 
        This subgenre emphasizes a DIY ethos that would form a base layer for what other genres on this list were inspired by. 
        This goes both sonically, lyrically, morally and how shows in general were handled. One notable example of this is Moshing, 
        originally called slam dancing, which was started because of Hardcore. 
        This is because hardcore is well.. Hardcore… It is nosier, louder, faster and overall more aggressive. 
        Lyrics were shouted and screamed and were controversial, a lot of the music was about modern disillusionment and anger in the system. 
        Hardcore is also what inspired a lot of the faster genres of metal. 
        Today modern hardcore still exists, ironically it has much more of a metal sound and does not sound like how it did back in the 80s! <br>

      <h2>Metal</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Does this genre need an introduction? Heavy metal is now a blanket term to describe all kinds of metal. However, traditional heavy metal has had loud distorted guitars, 
        tons of rhythm and “power chords” and loud drums and bass. For singers it can vary from singing, to yelling to screaming. It is often said that Heavy Metal is more akin to classical music compared to rock. Lyrics also vary but overall they can be about triumph, power or depression.  <br>

      <h2>Sludge Metal</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p> Sludge Metal is an extreme subgenre of Doom metal (bands like Black Sabbath). It sounds like a mixture of classic doom metal with elements of hardcore punk.As the 80s were rolling around, bands in both punk and metal were getting faster and faster. Sludge was a way of going against the grain. In fact, Black Flag is attributed with being a driving factor in the genre. They would intentionally play their music slower and slower which would anger their fans and those in the scene. The guitars and basses are downtuned and use tons of distortion and fuzz pedals. Tempo in Sludge can have sudden changes as well. Lyrical themes are usually dark in nature and are similar to hardcore punk. The lyrics themselves are usually scratchily sung and screamed.

      <h2>Post Punk</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p> Taking a sharp turn from other punk subgenres, Post Punk aimed to be a lot more experimental. It can incorporate a large and diverse spectrum.Similar to grunge, Post Punk is not only hard to define but it is also more about the era. While still based on the DIY Ethos of Punk, musicians thought punk had become a parody of itself. For the importance of this project, it is important to note that Post Punk typically focuses more on complexity, atmosphere, and experimentation in its music. Post punk tends to mix other genres of music to create a new sound.

      <p> An offshoot of post punk, gothic rock is very similar in sound, a lot of bands classified as post punk were also gothic rock. Gothic rock has a dark sound in both style, music, and lyrics. The sound and styling comes from the overall “goth” movement that was happening at the time. It was based on Victorian era clothing and gothic art.

      <h2>Grunge</h2> <!-- Updated title -->
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>This subgenre is more than just the music, it was also a fashion style. While music has been described as Grunge for years, it wasn't used in media until Sub Pop Records described Green River’s EP Dry As A Bone(1987) as "Gritty vocals, roaring Marshall amps, ultra-loose grunge that destroyed the morals of a generation." Grunge is typically described as having a murky and noisy guitar sound and an overall mix between punk and heavy metal with elements of Post Punk. However, Grunge bands can differ greatly sonically. If you wanted to be technical every single band played a different subgenre of punk/metal/rock, however they all were connected by their lyrics.Lyrically it is moody in tone, with themes of angst, depression, trauma and isolation. Vocals can be shouted or screamed or sung.

    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Shoegaze is often confused with dream pop. It started in Ireland and the UK. Stylistically they are nearly the same with some slight differences.  Shoegaze incorporates the dreamy and ambient aspects while adding a layer of noise to their music. A lot of shoegaze rifts are in alternative tuning and were also written in drones. Lyrically it was about love, loss and general emotions. However… it is often hard to make out what they are saying anyways. . Shoegaze is more inspire by rock then pop, which makes it also stand out from dream pop.The term Shoegaze was originally used to make fun of musicians who were making this genre of alternative rock, this is because the musicians would be looking down at their pedal boards the whole time instead of looking at the audience. This was in part they were constantly having to make tweaks to the boards and also was in part they actual artists were introverted and just were afraid to look at the audience.

    <div class="modal-body">
      <p>Right before shoegaze there was Dream Pop. While many argue they are one of the same genre, there are differences that will be discussed. Dream pop is a mixture of psychedelic rock and alternative pop music. Its focus is to create a dreamy atmospheric sound. Guitars will use a lot of effects in their pedal chains including reverb, chorus, and delay. Dream pop also makes use of synthesizers which help contribute to the ‘dreamy’ sound of the music. Vocals are usually ‘buried in the mix’ and can be about escapism and introspective thoughts.
