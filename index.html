    <h1>Grunge and Shoegaze Atlas</h1>
    <p1>In the early 90s, Grunge became a phenomena. A representaitve of feelings seattle youth had, grunge is something that may never be recreated again. 
        Around the same time, another genre of music was growing popular in the underground, Shoegaze. Both genres had a DIY ethos to it.
        However, shoegaze was all about using effects to create etheral sounding music with a layer of noise. On the other hand Grunge was just about 
        being raw and emotional. Both genres seem different at first, however as you dive into each you start to notice they have a lot of similarites. 
        This Atlas will be focusing on how each came into fruation, what it was like during the peak of each, and what happened after each genre fizzled out.
