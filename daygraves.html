<h1>The Daygraves Interview</h1>
<p1>Daygraves is a 'sort of post rock sort of Blackgaze' project. 
    I have been a fan of huge fan of him for a while now and I am beyond thankful for this opportunity.

    For added context, Blackgaze is another subgenre of shoegaze, but it is more inspired beyond
    Atmospheric Black Metal, which is a genre known for its aggressiveness and depressive moods.
    However, with the advent of Blackgaze many musicans are moving away from the controversial past of the genre
    and are now mixing it with the music shoegaze creates to create something new and beautiful. Some examples bands are
    Deafheaven and Alcest.

<p2><br>What inspired you to start make your style of music? Any bands in particular?<br> </p2>

<p3><br>I had been listening to lots of Show Me A Dinosaur, Woods of Desolation and Trautonist. I also liked that the genre has an element of lofi recording/mixing which made me feel like i might could the project on my own.<br></p3>

<p2><br>Do you listen to any Grungegaze? If so what do you think of it?<br> </p2>

<p3><br>I like a lot of it. Grivo, Slowcrush, Spotlights (if they count), Greet Death.  For me, it feels a bit nostalgic since i was a teen during the peak of the grunge days.<br></p3>

<p2><br>Do you believe these heavier styles of shoegaze has a future in the mainstream?<br> </p2>
<p3><br> I doubt it but it’s possible. I think that the internet has made culture so wide that the “mainstream” hardly exists and becomes less relevant every day.  However, now that bands like Knocked Loose are on late night TV, I suppose anything can happen. <br></p3>

<p2><br> How do you navigate creating blackgaze from a spiritual perspective? It’s been fascinating to me how people have been changing an evil genre of music and kind of making it into something more beautiful.<br></p2>

<p3><br>I try not to think about it much. I just make music that I like and once the music is made, I try to attach lyrics that are meaningful to me. Since i’m spiritual person, they come out spiritual but I don’t go into a song with the goal of pushing a spiritual agenda
    i just try and make music that most accurately represents my tastes and my thoughts.
</p3>

<p2><br>Do you have a favorite song/project you have made? <br></p2>

<p3><br> My favorite track is probably The Final Empire, which is funny because the stats show me it’s one of my least popular songs.<br></p3>
