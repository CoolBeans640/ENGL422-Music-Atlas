<h3>Map of Seattle</h3>
<p1>My next map is a map of Seattle and important places in the grunge scene. Sources are embeded into the map itself, 
    click on a location and you will get information about the place. Make sure to zoom out as their is a lot of places to see!
    Overall this map shows how close knit and DIY the scene was back in the 90s.
